## Chat Completions for Single-Turn Tasks
# Chat messages are sent as a **list of messages**, where each message has:- a `role` → system / user / assistant- a `content` → the text### 🔹 Important Rule for Single-Turn TasksFor **single-turn questions**, we usually **do NOT send assistant messages**.The model generates a response using:- its existing knowledge- the **system message**- the **user message**
### Example (Single-Turn)```System: You are a helpful Python tutor.User: What is a list in Python?```No assistant message is needed here.

## Why Use the Assistant Role? (Providing Examples)The **main purpose** of the assistant role is to **give examples**.This is very useful for:- shot prompting- controlling tone (simple, formal, friendly)- controlling format (steps, bullets, code + explanation)👉 This is a **structured way of shot prompting**.

## Assistant Role with Examples (Python Tutor Example)Let’s say we are building a **Python programming tutor app**.We can teach the AI how to respond by giving it **example conversations**.### ✅ Example Structure```System: You are a Python tutor who explains concepts simply.User: What is a variable in Python?Assistant: A variable is a container used to store data.Example:x = 10Here, x stores the value 10.User: What is a loop in Python?```👉 The AI now understands:- how detailed the answer should be- that examples are required- the teaching style

## How the Response WorksThe output is accessed the **same way** as before (message → content).Because we gave an **assistant example**, the AI now replies in:- similar tone- similar length- similar structure

## System vs Assistant vs User (Very Important)Let’s clearly understand **where to put examples** 👇### 🟦 System Role → Rules & GuardrailsUse this when:- output must follow a strict format- behavior must never change✅ Example:```System: Always answer in simple English and include one example.```Think of it as rules the AI must obey.

### Assistant Role → Example AnswersUse this when:- you want to show **how answers should look**- you want consistent style in conversations✅ Example:```User: What is a function?Assistant: A function is a block of reusable code.Example:def greet():    print("Hello")```Best for **multi-turn chatbots**.

### User Role → Context or Task-Specific ExamplesUse this when:- context is needed to understand the task- it’s a one-time task✅ Example (Job Advertisement):```User: Here is an old job ad. Create a new one similar to this.[old job ad text]```Common in **single-turn tasks**.

## Summary Table:Role-	Purpose-	When to Use
# System-	Rules & behavior-	Fixed output format, restrictions
# Assistant-	Example responses-	Style, tone, teaching pattern
# User-	Question or task-	Context or instructions


### 📝 Practice Task
# Create a chatbot that:- teaches Python basics- gives short explanations- always includes an example
# Use:- system role → rules- assistant role → example answer- user role → question
# > The **assistant role is not just for replies** — it is a **powerful teaching tool** to guide how the AI should respond.
